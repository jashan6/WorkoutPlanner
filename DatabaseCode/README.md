Train4Goals-Database

Currently is a database file that can be used with MySQL. Requires importing to a MySQL server, XAAMP being the best way to run it locally. Will include instructions at a later date.

TODO:
- [ ] Elaborate on the tags, what they are for and how to use them (or add more fields to elaborate on the tags)
  - Fields in tags include limiting (dietary restrictions, preferences, etc.) options, as well as if the meal is good for weight gain, weight loss, or no weight change
- [ ] Design REST API. Will have to include instructions on how to run it.
- [ ] Add survey support. May need to update the tables to add the survey.
- [ ] Create Procedures. If this doesn't get done, no big deal, but will help with API designing.
